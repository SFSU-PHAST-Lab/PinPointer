# PinPointer

PinPointer is an error measurement system that enables motor behavior researchers to quickly and easily calculate 
the error (x-axis, y-axis, and radial error distances) between an object and target location (e.g., a golf ball 
and hole). PinPointer automatically calculates statistical measures for each error type which can be exported for 
additional analysis.
